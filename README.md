**Text Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms for Recipe Analysis**  

This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools and implementations for text preprocessing and machine learning techniques applied to recipe datasets. It offers features for text tokenization, Hashing TF-IDF vectorization, and the training of various machine learning models using a dataset named *Sentiment.csv*.  

Additionally, it includes methods for calculating cosine and centered cosine similarity metrics between recipes and their ingredients. These metrics, derived from a second dataset called *recipes_combined.csv*, are instrumental in developing recipe recommendation systems and performing ingredient analysis.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Text Processing:** Efficient text vectorization using tokenizers and Hashing TF-IDF.  
2. **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation and evaluation of multiple algorithms for sentiment analysis and prediction.  
3. **Similarity Analysis:** Computation of cosine and centered cosine similarity metrics to enhance recipe recommendations and ingredient comparisons.
